# my_educational_projects
Here are my educational projects:

1) AA testing - a repository with analysis of some mobile app data: a splitter system's work was checked

2) AB testing - a repository with analysis of customers behavior using AB-testing

3) Airflow - a repository with script, sending a report in VK chat about one of announcements from Airbnb occupancy using python / bash DAG

4) Bootstrap - a repository with analysis of confidence interval using bootstrap

5) Computational Chemistry - a repository with scripts for quantum / classical calculations in chemistry

6) Python tasks:
					- 1. choosing best pair of goods using history of purchases
					- 2. notebook with thre groups of customers analysis using t-test, mannwhitney, ANOVA, pairwise Tukey criteria
					- 3. TV traffic analysis - EDA
					- 4. polyimide in C6H5COOH - a script for calculation initial amounts of reagents for polyimide synthesis in benzoic acid
7) Regression:
				- 1. analysis of cars market - which features are the most important and should be used in model
				- 2. prediction of orders number using linear regression and Facebook Prophet (the last is just for prophet study not for serious prediction)
			  
8) RFM-segmentation - performing RFM-segmentation of some shop customers using python

9) SQL - big query with variety of SQL-operators usage
